Part1:
Ray generation is the first step in the rendering pipeline where rays are cast from the camera (or eye) into the scene. Each ray corresponds to a pixel on the screen. The direction of the ray is determined by the camera's position, the pixel's position on the screen, and the field of view. The ray is defined by its origin (usually the camera's position) and its direction. Once rays are generated, the next step is to determine if they intersect with any objects (primitives) in the scene. This is done by testing each ray against all the primitives in the scene. The goal is to find the closest intersection point along the ray, which will determine the color of the pixel.


The triangle intersection algorithm implemented in code determines whether a ray intersects with a triangle using the MÃ¶ller-Trumbore method. It calculates the barycentric coordinates and the distance along the ray to the intersection point, ensuring that the intersection is valid and within the ray's bounds. If an intersection is found, the relevant data is stored in the Intersection object for further processing in the rendering pipeline.

In has_intersection, the function checks if a ray intersects with a triangle by computing edge vectors (E1, E2) and the vector from the triangle's first vertex to the ray's origin (S). It then calculates cross products (S1, S2) and uses them to determine the barycentric coordinates (b1, b2, b0) and the distance t along the ray to the intersection point. The function returns true if the intersection is valid, meaning t lies within the ray's bounds (r.min_t to r.max_t) and the barycentric coordinates are within the range [0, 1]. The intersect function builds on this by performing the same calculations but also records the intersection details in an Intersection object if a valid intersection is found. It updates the object with the distance t, the triangle primitive, the BSDF (material properties), and the interpolated normal at the intersection point, which is computed as a weighted sum of the triangle's vertex normals (n1, n2, n3) using the barycentric coordinates. Both functions ensure efficient and accurate ray-triangle intersection testing, with intersect providing additional data for shading and rendering purposes.


Part 2: BVH Construction Algorithm and Heuristic for Splitting
The Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) construction algorithm recursively partitions a set of primitives into a tree structure to accelerate ray-primitive intersection tests. The algorithm begins by computing the bounding box (bbox) of all primitives in the current node and calculating the centroid of these bounding boxes (mean). If the number of primitives (n) is less than or equal to the max_leaf_size, the node is marked as a leaf, storing the primitives and their bounding box. Otherwise, the algorithm splits the primitives into two groups based on a heuristic. The heuristic chosen here is to split along the longest axis of the bounding box (x, y, or z) to ensure balanced partitions. The primitives are divided into two subsets: those with centroids less than the mean along the chosen axis go to the left child, and the rest go to the right child. This process repeats recursively for each child node until all nodes are either leaves or satisfy the splitting condition.

The intersection functions (has_intersection and intersect) traverse the BVH to efficiently determine if a ray intersects any primitive. Starting at the root, the ray is tested against the node's bounding box. If there is no intersection, the traversal stops. For leaf nodes, the ray is tested against all primitives in the node. For internal nodes, the traversal continues recursively into the left and right children. The has_intersection function short-circuits as soon as it finds any intersection, while intersect updates the closest intersection point in the Intersection object. This hierarchical structure significantly reduces the number of intersection tests by culling large groups of primitives early in the traversal.

In summary, the BVH construction algorithm uses a longest-axis splitting heuristic to create a balanced tree, and the intersection functions leverage this structure to efficiently cull irrelevant primitives and minimize ray-primitive intersection tests.
